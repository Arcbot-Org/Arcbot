Arcbot is an extensible chatbot written entirely in Python, inspired by Err and Hubot projects.
The goal of Arcbot is to provide a simple to extend bot framework for Discord chat service.

Arcbot is open source software and released under the GPL v3 license. See LICENCE.txt for more info.

# Under construction
This bot is seeing a redesign given the updates done to the Discord API

The goal of this project will to be more robust and meet pairity with the API
This project is a place I can play with design ideas and make something of the highest quality I can be proud of and also something I can use as an acedemic project and learn about a lot of new libraries and tools available to me as Python continues to grow.
